const app = require("./app");

app.listen(5500, function () {
  console.log(`Started on 5500`);
});

// Gallery images is not showing up

// The app books a reservation and links to Stripe page but what if user changes mind and hits back button, the reservation is already saved. Is there a way to undo?
